Hello world!

	Welcome to my portfolio - at time of creation, I'm  finishing up my junior year of college as
a computer science major. I enjoy both web and software development, as well as that feeling
you get after an entire day of trying to debug a program and just when you're about to give up,
you solve the problem and then you're "back in business". 

	This file will contain links to all of my professional projects - not school-related assignments.
At this point in time I'm nowhere near the best - there's still a lot left to be learned. I'm getting
better everyday and soon this will prove that statement to be true.

	For now, take a look at some of my work - what's the worst that could happen?
